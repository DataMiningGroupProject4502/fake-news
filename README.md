### Project Description

Fake news and misinformation have been topics of growing conversation and interest over the past few years, and the field of study on this topic has been growing as well. We will be analyzing the real and fake articles for key similarities and differences on the body text of the articles alone. We are not primarily focusing on the AI driven classification of real vs fake news, but analyzing the articles once the classification has been made for differences that could potentially be caught by the average news reader.


### Questions
1. Is there an association between length of article and the realness of news?
2. What words are most commonly used in real vs fake news?
3. Is there a time when more fake news started showing up (in the Harvard set)?
4. What categories (sports, politics, entertainment) are more prone to fake news?
5. What publications are more prone to publish fake news?

### Applications of Knowledge

- The average reader will not be able to deduce if an article is fake based off article length alone
- The average reader will not be able to deduce if an article is fake based off word choice alone
- Fake news articles tend to be posted more frequently during election cycles in the United States
- Political news is by far the category most prone to fake news
- It is clear that certain publishers of news generate much more fake news than others, so it is important when getting news to verify the integrity of the publisher before trusting what you read
